I am a Power Systems Engineer and Researcher driven by the goal of advancing the field rather than merely joining the conversation. With experience spanning both industry and academia, I aim to explore how AI enhances power system planning, operation, and control, and how emerging technologies can reshape the future of energy systems.

## Languages {#languages}

**Arabic** (native), **English** (fluent), **French** (fluent), **German** (B1)   

Fun fact: I read the original 1962 French paper on AC Optimal Power Flow, *Contribution à l'étude du dispatching économique*, to preserve nuances that can get lost in translation.   
That curiosity later pushed me to start learning German — though I haven’t yet been brave enough to read a technical paper in it... *vielleicht* one day!
